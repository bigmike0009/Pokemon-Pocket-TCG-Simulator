üîÅ Game Flow
    Setup:

        -Each player uses a 20-card deck with no more than two copies of any card.

        -Draw 5 cards to form your starting hand; the game ensures at least one Basic Pok√©mon is present, eliminating mulligans.

        -Place one Active Pok√©mon and up to three on the Bench.

        -Decide who goes first with a coin flip.


    Turn Structure:

        Draw Phase: 
            -Draw one card (except on the first turn for the starting player).
            -One energy is added to your energy zone. If the player's deck has more than one type of energy, one is chosen at random. Only one energy is available in the energy zone at a time, but players can see what the next energy will be in their deck.

        Main Phase:
        These events are optional and can be done in any order
        Once complete you can proceed to attack phase or end turn without attacking

            -Play Basic Pok√©mon to the Bench (maximum of three).

            -Evolve Pok√©mon (once per Pok√©mon per turn). It can not be done the first turn a card is played

            -Attach one Energy from the Energy Zone to a Pok√©mon.

            -Play one Supporter card.

            -Play as many item cards as you want

            -Use Abilities (once per Pok√©mon per turn).

            -Retreat the Active Pok√©mon by paying its Retreat Cost.

        Attack Phase:

            -Attack with the Active Pok√©mon if it has sufficient Energy.

            -Apply damage and effects; if the opponent's Pok√©mon is Knocked Out, earn points accordingly.

            -Attacks will end the turn automatically

        Pokemon Check(after ending turn):
            There is a phase for status effects at the end of each Player's turn where all pokemon will be checked by the game. 
            If you have a status condition, the game will make you take damage, do a coin toss, or recover naturally.

    Winning the Game:

        -Earn points by Knocking Out opponent's Pok√©mon:

        -Regular Pok√©mon: 1 point.

        -Pok√©mon ex: 2 points.

        -The first player to reach 3 points wins.

üåÄ Status Conditions

They can be cured by evolving a pokemon, moving it to your bench, and by certain abilities and trainer cards

        -Paralyzed: The Pok√©mon cannot attack or retreat during its next turn. This effect is automatically dispelled after one turn

        -Confused: When attempting to attack, do a coin flip the attack may fail. This condition will last until cured

    -First Turn Advantage: Going second allows for Energy attachment and potentially attacking, offering a strategic edge.

    -Status Effects: Conditions like Poison, Sleep, Paralysis, Burn, and Confusion function similarly to the traditional TCG, affecting gameplay tactics
